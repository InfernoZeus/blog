I've just received my new XPS 13 (9360), which came with Ubuntu 16.04 pre-installed.
Follow along as I convert it to a fully-fledged hacking device (aka running ArchLinux).

### Rough Plan

Before I start, this is the rough order I expect to follow. I wonder how well I can stick to it...

  1. Check out pre-installed bootloader/EFI utils. Do I need to save any stubs, or recovery tools?
  2. Install [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/). I love rEFInd. It's so simple, and much better looking than Grub.
  3. Install ArchLinux. I want to try out some type of snap-shotting to allow for rollbacks.
  4. Choose a dotfile manager. This is something I've never used before, but would really love to try some.
  5. Setup Zsh or Fish. Bash is boring - well, not really, but why not try something new!
